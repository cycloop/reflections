When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Letting others contribute to a project. Collaborate with other people. Get feedback
  about code that i have written. Store safely the files of a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because it might conflict with the commits i have done after the last push!?
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

  Forks are repositories which i can't change in github so i copy them in my account and i can 
  change them as my own without making any changes in the original.
  Clones are repositories on github that i copy from github on my computer using the command
  git clone <url-of-repository> and then i can work on it. When you clone a repository git makes
  automaticaly a remote with the name "origin".
  Branches are kind of copies of pre-existing branch ,like master branch, at which i can make 
  changes change or add features and add documentation without affecting the master branch or
  any other.
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  You can merge the two branches, if somebody else has changed the github file, in order to 
  push the two version on github later so as to be updated.
