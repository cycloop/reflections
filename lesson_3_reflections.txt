When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Letting others contribute to a project. Collaborate with other people. Get feedback
  about code that i have written. Store safely the files of a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because it might conflict with the commits i have done after the last push!?
