What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When i initialize a repository git is making a secret file called ".git" in which
	it tracks any changes to the files i have added to track.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is the place where i have added which files i will be tracking
	whereas the working directory contains all the files i will be working on.
	The repository finally is the place where the different version will be saved.
	It adds the value of making your own choice rather than git taking over and 
	saving all the files.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
    
	By running "git diff --staged" i can see the difference between the files i want 
	to commit and the previous ones so i can check how many logical changes i have
	made.
